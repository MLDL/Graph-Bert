# Graph-Bert
Source code of "Graph-Bert: Only Attention is Needed for Learning Graph Representations". 

The paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05140

Please check the script.py as the entry point. We suggest to run the code with Pycharm. 

Several toolkits may be needed to run the code
(1) pytorch
(2) sklearn
(3) transformers
(4) networkx
